Coming soon, a site that will make sure every human has a mate by 2025-ish.

2030 for the really ugly people.

I'm  just kidding.

Y'all all beautiful and there is someone out there for everyone.

The ugliest people, truth be told, are the ones that lie to your face and say they love you.

Nothing uglier than that. We'll all learn to look for those faces so none of us are lied to ever again.

Also coming soon for dogs, cats, birds, and more.

If you are interested in having a mate by 2025 or you already have a mate and want to keep that person through 2025, fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsgDtxQ8R5-Z5mb8CyLjPr4hk-5fI4wViAFfmxdkkJM2PEZw/viewform?hl=en" target="_blank" class="font-weight-bold">google form</a> with your email, approximate location, and a favorite pizza arrangement.
